# SpeciesDistributionHabitatModelling
 
In this repository are two scripts designed to create species distribution models from known presence locations. SDHMmain is the primary script where you input your data, set your parameters, select your predictors, and recieve your output. SDHMfunctions is a script containing functions written to make the main script run, you should never need to alter the functions script. Also provided is a CSV of random points throughout the state of Utah, provided as a placeholder for your own data.
